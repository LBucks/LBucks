Hello, my name is Lennard Bucks and I could be considered a software engineer.
Why "could be considered" you may ask.. Well, my interests lie primarily in robotics and industrial automation.
This includes 'everything', so its what is defined as 'Mechatronics'. Software and hardware. I have a background in electrical engineering but my main expertise lies with software.
That about sums me up enough for what I want to share on github, if you want to know more about me you can contact me via LinkedIn. :)

Not sure if only I can see this, I would assume anyone can. So hi ðŸ‘‹
